### ‚úçÔ∏è Write-up:

By reverse image searching the given photo, we discover similar shots pointing to an airport in **Hawaii**. Using this clue, we explore the **Hawaiian Islands** on **Google Maps**.

Focusing on **Honolulu**, we find it has two notable airports. Upon closer inspection, the layout and features seen in the image closely match those of **Kalaeloa Airport**, formerly known as Barbers Point Naval Air Station.

Next, we analyze the **aircraft** in the image. The visible **"USAF"** marking on the upper wing suggests it belongs to the **United States Air Force**. Judging by the aircraft‚Äôs size and configuration, it appears to be either a **cargo** or **tanker** aircraft.

After comparing details with photos from **Wikipedia** and aviation photo sites, we identify the aircraft as the **KC-135 Stratotanker** ‚Äî a mid-air refueling aircraft. The KC-135 is one of the few USAF planes that has "USAF" painted across the top of its wings in the same manner as seen in the image.

Therefore, we conclude:

* **Airport**: Kalaeloa Airport
* **Aircraft**: KC-135 Stratotanker
