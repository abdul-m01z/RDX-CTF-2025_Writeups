
## **“Symbol of defence”**

**Author:** Huzaifa Zia



### 🕵️ Description:

*The journey begins with a symbol of national pride — a lone flag, painted on the earth, marking more than just territory. Its crescent cradles a star whose coordinates, when measured precisely, reveal a gateway to a fortress of steel and strategy. This flag is not just a marker — it's the name of the location you're seeking. Nearby lies a symbol encircled: a machine of war, surrounded by three letters that define a legacy of defense. The year this image was taken whispers from the metadata of open skies, waiting to be extracted. Your task: triangulate the star's exact coordinates, decode the embedded symbols, and uncover the fortified heart of Pakistan’s armored might. What year does the satellite bear witness to this national sentinel?*

### ✍️ Write-up:

You're given the hint that this is a **defense-related site**. Starting with the image of a **lone Pakistani flag painted on the ground**, you begin inspecting military or industrial zones in **Pakistan** using **Google Earth** or **Google Maps (satellite view)**.

Eventually, you find the exact match at coordinates **33.72°N, 72.82°E**, located near **Taxila** — a known defense and industrial hub.

Zooming in, the scene aligns perfectly with the description. A **large Pakistani flag** is visible on the ground, and close by, there’s a **circular emblem** containing a **tank** and the word **"HIT"** below it. This symbol is the official logo of **Heavy Industries Taxila (HIT)** — Pakistan’s premier military production complex.

To determine the **year** the image was taken, you use the **historical imagery feature** in **Google Earth Pro**. Rolling back the timeline, the satellite image showing both the flag and the HIT logo clearly is from **2024**.
